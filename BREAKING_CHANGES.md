# Breaking Changes

## Upcoming

### Files excluded by `.gitignore` are now ignored ([#1234](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/pull/1234))

Ruff will now avoid checking files that are excluded by a `.gitignore`. This behavior is powered by
the [`ignore`](https://docs.rs/ignore/latest/ignore/struct.WalkBuilder.html#ignore-rules), and is
applied in addition to Ruff's built-in `exclude` system.

Note that hidden files (i.e., files and directories prefixed with a `.`) are _not_ ignored by
default.

## 0.0.178

### Configuration files are now resolved hierarchically ([#1190](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/pull/1190))

`pyproject.toml` files are now resolved hierarchically, such that for each Python file, we find
the first `pyproject.toml` file in its path, and use that to determine its lint settings.

See the [README](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff#pyprojecttoml-discovery) for more.
